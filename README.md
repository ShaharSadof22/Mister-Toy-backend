Mister toy build for shop owners and allows them to manage their shop.
We need normal users to be able to add their toy's to the shop.
In the the app you will find a dashboard page with charts:

o Prices per toy type(Adult, Educational etc.)
o Toys per year

On the main page, there is a map with all the shops with their position.
